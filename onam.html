<p>The festival of Onam is celebrated throughout the state of Kerala. Kerala during Onam is
marked by happiness, excitement and enjoyment among all sections of people. Onam is
celebrated as an outcome of reasons that have to do with mythology as well as old agrarian
practices. If one is to go by the myth, then King Mahabali or Maveli was a generous and
virtuous ruler, who had once ruled Kerala. This occasion is celebrated by all Keralites as Onam.
And the other cause for celebrating Onam is because it is the time of the year when a good
harvest has been gathered all over Kerala, resulting in plenitude and happiness. </p>

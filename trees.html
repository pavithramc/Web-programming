 <P>Trees and forests are fundamental to life, acting as nature's lungs by producing oxygen and absorbing carbon dioxide to regulate climate and air quality. They are vital for biodiversity, providing food and shelter for countless species and forming crucial habitats. Forests are also essential resources for humans, offering wood, paper, and medicines, while also preventing soil erosion, controlling floods, and maintaining soil fertility. However, deforestation for urban expansion and resource extraction poses a serious threat, leading to ecological damage, loss of biodiversity, and climate change. Therefore, protecting and expanding forests through conscious efforts like tree planting is crucial for a sustainable future.</P>

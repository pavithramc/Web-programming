<p>Holi is a popular and significant Hindu festival celebrated as the Festival of Colours, Love,
and Spring. It celebrates the eternal and divine love of the deities Radha and Krishna.
Additionally, the day signifies the triumph of good over evil, as it commemorates the victory
of Vishnu as Narasimha over Hiranyakashipu. Holi originated and is predominantly celebrated
in the Indian subcontinent, but has also spread to other regions of Asia and parts of the Western
world through the Indian diaspora. </p>

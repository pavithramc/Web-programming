 <P>Tarmac, or tarmacadam, is a road and driveway surfacing material made from a mixture of crushed stone and tar. Developed in the early 20th century as an enhancement to earlier macadam roads, it provides a durable, dust-free, and smooth surface. While once popular, its use has declined in favor of modern asphalt, or "bitmac," due to asphalt's superior durability under heavy loads and extreme weather. The term "tarmac" also persists in common usage, particularly in aviation, to describe the paved areas at an airport, even though these surfaces are now typically asphalt or concrete.</P>
